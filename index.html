        <h1> Welcome to Shrey's Website </h1>

        <h2> Introduction:</h2>
        
        <p> My name is Shrey Sahni, I was born in Houston, Texas although I have lived all around the world.
            I lived in Bangkok, Thailand for roughly 7 years, which is the second largest amount of time I lived somewhere
            besides Houston(I lived for 8+ years). I have also lived in Dhaka, Bangladesh for 2 years as well as Bakersfield,
            California for two years as well, meaning that I am not really a stranger to moving and engaging in new cultures and 
            traditions. I love playing basketball, watching sports and movies, and playing video games. Currently, I love watching
            the generation transfomers 1 tv series from the mid 1980s onwards, and have finished the first season in about a week. 
            I also love airplanes, cars, and dinosaurs. 
            <br><br>
            In fact, my grandfather is a paleontologist, and one of his most uncovered dinsoaurs he found, is my favorite dinosaur known as the Allosaurus. This dinosaur is extremely famous, and is featured
            in many jurassic park/world films and is a fan-favorite to many. I also love the Jurassic Park/World series for this reason
            and have seen every one of them on a consistent basis. Apart from that though, I love cars and have seen all of the Fast and
            Furious films as well. I love watching car reviews, and have recently been watching a lot of Formula one racing, and have 
            been engaging in the modern area of motorsport racing. 

            <br><br>
            From an aviation standpoint, I have always loved airplanes, and since I have lived abroad for such a long time, I love traveling. 
            I am a huge fan of long-haul journeys and love plane-spotting in major airports.
